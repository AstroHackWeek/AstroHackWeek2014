Useful Literature
==================

Here is a bunch of papers and books that you may find useful for further information. Books are marked with (b), papers with (p).

Daniela:
-   Simon Vaughan: Scientific Inference *(b)*
    An excellent and intuitive introduction to classical statistics
    at the senior undergraduate level. I pulled most of my talk together 
    using this book. Incidentally, it uses R rather than python, but for R
    it has lots of very nice examples and exercises that allow you to learn
    basic R along with your statistics

-   Željko Ivezić, Andrew J. Connolly, Jacob T. VanderPlas & Alexander Gray: 
    Statistics, Data Mining and Machine Learning in Astronomy *(b)* 
    This book is more geared towards data mining and machine learning, but has
    two introductory chapters into probability and classical statistical 
    inference. It uses AstroML, which is in python. 

-   David Hogg: Data analysis recipes: Probability calculus for inference (2012) *(p)*
    short and straightforward introduction to probabilities and scientific inference

-   Protassov+: Statistics, Handle with Care: Detecting Multiple Model Components
    with the Likelihood Ratio Test (2002) *(p)*
    Useful reference paper for when (and why) likelihood ratio tests and F-tests fail at
    model selection

-   Roberto Trotta: Bayes in the sky: Bayesian inference and model selection in cosmology (2008) *(p)*
    Mostly Bayesian paper, but has a bit about model selection and information criteria
    that I found quite useful to read.

-   Andrew Liddle: Information criteria for astrophysical model selection (2007) *(p)*
    More stuff about information criteria
